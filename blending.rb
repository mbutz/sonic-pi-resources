# Fading with `tick`, `range` and `line`

# Why you have to `ramp` the `range` or `line`:
# `range`/`line`:
# Create a new ring buffer from the range/line arguments.
# Indexes wrap around; that is where `ramp` comes into play:
# ramp:
# Create a new immutable ramp vector. Indexes always return first or
# last value if out of bounds.

#-----------------------------------------------------
# Fading using `line`
#-----------------------------------------------------

# Note:
# How short or how long your fade will be depends
# 1. The amount of values resp. the stepsize of your `range`/`line`
# 2. The duration of your `live_loop`

# This is probably more intuitive because you define the amount of steps
# rather than the step size: if you have a `live_loop` running 0.25 beats
# long 16 steps = 1 bar will bring the volume from 0 to 1 (so if your fade
# should take 4 bars to go from 0 to 1 you'll have to set 64 steps).

# Fading using `line` and `at`
#-----------------------------------------------------

# `at` is very useful to create rhythmical patterns because
# it is somehow more intuitive to musicians then working e. g.
# with `sleep`; `sleep` defines the time distance from a previous
# event whereas `at` defines an event on the base of larger unit
# as e. g. a bar; see the following `live_loop` which has 4 beats
# = 1 bar; to fade while using at we will have to to devide our
# line into groups with a length matching the number of values
# passed to `at`. In the following case I use `vol` to define the
# base values for the fading operation; then I multiply each base
# value with the number of kicks per beat so that each run of the
# loop the volume is raised. (Sorry, I feel that this explanation
# could be much clearer, I will have to fix that)

live_loop :fade_in_with_line_and_at do
  stop
  # define the kick pattern
  ptn = (ring 0,1,2,3,3.25)
  # define the fade
  vol = (line 0, 1, inclusive: true, steps: 10).ramp
  # make groups of values with a length that matches the one of ptn
  vols = (knit vol.tick, ptn.size)

# Smooth Fades: Fade using control and double-tick
